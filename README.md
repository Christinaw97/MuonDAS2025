## Facilitators

- Jan-Frederik Schulte (jschulte@cern.ch)

## Technical setup

This exercise is designed for, and tested at, the [Purdue Analysis Facility](https://analysis-facility.physics.purdue.edu/en/latest/) (AF). In general, it is expected to run where the following requirements are fulfilled:

* python3
* uproot
* awkward
* ROOT
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* Jupyter Notebook
* coffea 
* boost

However, the input files used in the exercises are specific to the Purdue AF and will need to be replaced when running somewhere else. 

The Purdue AF is available for anyone with a valid CERN account. To log in, go to [https://cms.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu/hub](https://cms.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu/hub) and select the CERN SSO to log in. Then start an instance with the default settings for CPU and memory, those will be sufficient. After your instance has been created, open a terminal to download this repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/Taiantuia/MuonHATSatLPC2020.git
```
